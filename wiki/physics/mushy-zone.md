# Mushy zone

**Category:** physics

---

## Overview

The **mushy zone** is the two-phase solid+liquid region between the
liquidus and solidus isotherms. It behaves as a porous medium with a
**permeability K(gs)** that plunges sharply as solid fraction grows —
classically Kozeny–Carman or Heinrich–Poirier expressions. Flow through
the mushy zone controls macrosegregation, freckle formation
([[wiki/physics/freckle-segregation|freckle segregation]]), and convective heat/solute transport
([[wiki/flow/thermosolutal-convection|thermosolutal convection]]).

## Why µg helps

Buoyancy vanishes → interdendritic liquid stays put → segregation signal
becomes mostly diffusive → ideal validation for
[[wiki/modelling/sharp-interface|sharp-interface]] / [[wiki/modelling/CA-FE-models|CA FE models]] codes.
[[../Spurious grain formation due to Marangoni convection during directional solidification of alloys in u-g environment of International Space Station_SEYED.pdf|Seyed — Marangoni-driven spurious grains ISS]] however shows **Marangoni flow still
persists** on ISS and creates spurious grains — µg is not a vacuum of
fluid dynamics.

## Key quantities

- Primary arm spacing **λ1** — Hunt / Kurz scaling.
- Secondary arm spacing **λ2** — Feurer-Wunderlin coarsening ∝ t^(1/3).
- Permeability K(gs) — calibrated via [[wiki/methods/synchrotron-Xray|X-ray radiography]].
- Local solid fraction gs — drives heat and solute advection terms.
